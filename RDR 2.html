    <h2>Story Overview</h2>
    <img src="https://example.com/rdr2-story.jpg" alt="Red Dead Redemption 2 Story">
    <p>
        Red Dead Redemption 2 is set in 1899 and follows the story of Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang, led by the charismatic Dutch Van der Linde. The gang is on the run from law enforcement and rival groups after a robbery goes wrong in the town of Blackwater. As the gang tries to survive and adapt to the changing world, they face internal strife and moral dilemmas that test their loyalty and values.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout the game, Arthur grapples with his own beliefs and the impact of his actions. He builds relationships with other gang members, including John Marston, who later becomes the protagonist of the first game. The narrative explores themes of loyalty, redemption, and the harsh realities of life in the fading Wild West.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the story progresses, tensions rise within the gang, leading to betrayals and tragic consequences. The clash between the old ways and the encroaching modern world culminates in a heartbreaking conclusion that reshapes Arthur's understanding of right and wrong.
